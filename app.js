 But I do remember that your birthday is on 15th sep and the time is 12.05 am. 
So I had planned not to wish you today but tomorrow at 12.00 am. 
I have done it by intention and no I havent forgot your birthday. 
Since you called me up from our own and said today is your birthday I felt very bad so I am taking this initiative. 
I hope you have received my gift ðŸ™‚'));
